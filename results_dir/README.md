Just some simple code to parse/visualize a few time series datasets. This is mostly just for me, but figured I'd share it for others who may be using the same data.

Currently works with:
- MSRC-12
- PAMAP
- PAMAP2
- The UCR Time Series datasets

To actually run this code, you should just need to change a few directory names in paths.py.
